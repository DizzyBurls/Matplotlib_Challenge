# Matplotlib Challenge

    Homework Task 5
    Writen by Chris Burley

# Name of Project:

    Homework Task 5
    Part Names: (1) Conclusions and Insights   (2) Pymaceuticals

# Description:

	In this project I have written scripts which, to my knowledge, satisfy every section of the task. 
	In addition, I have also written code which automates some of the data cleaning processess that were only required to be done manually.
	See screen captures 1 - 9 which I have uploaded to this repository. They show main features that we were required to create.

# Activation of a script:

	To run these scripts: 

	(1) Open the Jupyter Source File (pymaceutical_starter) which can be found in my Git Hub repository.

	(2) Run it in a Jupyter notebook.
    
	(3) Run the scripts in the order that they appear.
